/// A container for all parameters and options for the EANT2 algorithm. See constants for default
/// values.
///
/// Using default options is convenient, but may slightly reduce the quality of the neural networks
/// generated, and can increase the time needed to find a solution. It is recommended to adjust the
/// parameters depending on whether it is more important to find a solution quickly or to find a
/// better solution. Note that increasing population size and CMA-ES runs will only affect the
/// quality a small amount, so using smaller values will greatly speed up the algorithm, and does
/// not have a large downside. It is important to set the fitness threshold using the
/// `fitness_threshold` method, otherwise the algorithm may terminate too soon or take a long time to
/// run. Here are some general tips for setting the options (more in the documentation):
/// 
/// If a minimal neural network is preferred, increase `similar_fitness` and increase the weight for
/// connection removal. For complex problems, decrease population size and the weights for adding
/// connections and neurons.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use eant2::*;
///
/// // A set of default options, with 2 inputs and 3 outputs to each neural network
/// let options = EANT2Options::new(2, 3);
///
/// // A set of options with 4 CMA-ES optimizations per individual, a minimum fitness of 10.0, and
/// // a population size of 50
